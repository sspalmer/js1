var favHobby = "I have a goal to make an app by the end of the year. To prove to myself that I have or can learn the skills to do so. I also need to make more money and investments to set myself up for old age. I hope this class gets me a step closer to both goals while allowing me into a community I'm proud of being a part of. Cooking has been my hobby and always came easy to me. It can be as simple or complex of an art and science as you want it to be. This year though I'm challenging myself and trying my hand at gardening. Wish me luck. ";
